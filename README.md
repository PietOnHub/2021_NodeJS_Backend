# 2021_NodeJS_Backend
A Playground for learning server side techniques in Node.js

## Wishlist for next sprints

- hosting node.js on aws
- switching from http to https
- using express.js (for better routing)
- code modulatiztion (especially delivering of html)
- using a state of the art authetication with front end encryption


## History

### 2021/06/20 - Init

These are my first steps building a node.js project from scratch without any dependencies. Personal milestones have been:

- Studying basic concepts of node.js like modules, scoping, events and file operations
- Learning different approach to regular "Browser JS"
- Adding an Event Emitter by usage as a logger
- Creating a basic http server with a few routes to handle
- Implementing FileStream Operations to serve a requested file
- Implementing download with usage of a filestream
- Prettifying with minimal portion of Bootstrap
- Simple user authetication by POST request (realy basic and unsecure atm, no sha3 etc. & no front end encryption)
